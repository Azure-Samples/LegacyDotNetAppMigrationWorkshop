# Open Hack - Challenge 04

---

Some legacy applications require native Windows functionality like:

* Authentication
* Delegation
* Database security

Containers are a good way to move applications to the cloud. Move the application to a container and retain this functionality.

## Use the [Custom](../../HOL/07-windows-containers/site) application for this exercise

## Helpful information

If you don't have a Windows machine but want to use one as a container host, we have deployed one to the environment set up in Open Hack 1.

## Stretch Goals

* Add access to file share to the app with delegation
* Add LDAP call to app
